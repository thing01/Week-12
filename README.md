# Week-12
Week 12 Maze

This process was difficult because the class material was pretty out of date with more recent innovations in the Unity XRI toolkit, but after a combination of different online tutorials shared by a classmate and the course material, I was able to get things working okay (finally). I'm prety far behind in the course work, so I didn't have time to really make this much more than what was shown in the tutorial.

I built this in Unity version 2020.3.29f1

To navigate the maze, the left thumbstick turns the player, and the left hand ray teleports with the grip button.

The right hand can pick up the key with the right grip.

I used the coroutines we learned in the 1st person assignment to make the door open upon unlock. 

Enjoy!
