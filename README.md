# Week-12
Week 12 Maze

This process was difficult because the class material was pretty out of date with more recent innovations in the Unity XRI toolkit, but after a combination of different online tutorials shared by a classmate and the course material, I was able to get things working okay (finally). 

I built this in Unity version 2020.3.29f1

I used the coroutines provided in the 1st person assignment to make the door open upon unlock. 

I only finally got the key to orient properly by trial and error. 

Enjoy!
